      <p>
	<br />
	<br />
	 Introduction:
	<br />
	 Welcome to the world of Back-End Development! This comprehensive guide is designed for beginners who want to learn back-end development from scratch. Back-end development focuses on server-side programming and database management to create the logic and functionality behind websites and web applications. This guide will take you through the fundamentals of back-end development, including server-side programming languages, databases, and APIs, providing you with a strong foundation to build robust and scalable web applications.
	<br />
